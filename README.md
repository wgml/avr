Mostly useless and boring.

This repository contains amateur projects created for avr architecture microcontrollers. I've been writting most of them for atmega16 mcu, however all should be working with any mcu  provided it fits desired specification.

Feel free to ```git clone``` and test anything yourself.

I've provided ```avr.tar.gz``` file contaning most of my configuration used to compile (avrdude, avrdudess, etc.). It should be updated soon to provide ftdi driver.

Dependencies

  - avr-gcc
  - avrdude (provided)
  - avr-gcc
  - Programming software (avrdudess, avr Burn-o-mat).
  
I'm using Linux system while writting thus I have not tested code on Windows / Mac. I guess everything should work smoothly as I  did not used any external libraries.
